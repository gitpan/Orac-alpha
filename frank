NAME
     DBD::Chart	- DBI driver abstraction for DBD::Chart::Plot and
     GD::Graph

SYNOPSIS
	     $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:Chart')
		 or die	"Cannot	connect: " . $DBI::errstr;
	     #
	     #	     create file if it deosn't exist, otherwise, just open
	     #
	     $dbh->do('CREATE TABLE mychart (name CHAR(10), ID INTEGER,	value FLOAT)')
		     or	die $dbh->errstr;

	     #	     add data to be plotted
	     $sth = $dbh->prepare('INSERT INTO mychart VALUES (?, ?, ?)');
	     $sth->bind_param(1, 'Values');
	     $sth->bind_param(2, 45);
	     $sth->bind_param(2, 12345.23);
	     $sth->execute or die 'Cannot execute: ' . $sth->errstr;

	     #	     and render	it
	     $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT BARCHART FROM	mychart');
	     $sth->execute or die 'Cannot execute: ' . $sth->errstr;
	     @row = $sth->fetchrow_array;
	     print $row[0];

	     # delete the chart
	     $sth = $dbh->prepare('DROP	TABLE mychart')
		     or	die "Cannot prepare: " . $dbh->errstr;
	     $sth->execute or die 'Cannot execute: ' . $sth->errstr;

DESCRIPTION
     The DBD::Chart provides a DBI abstraction for rendering pie
     charts, bar charts, and line and point graphs.

     For detailed usage	information, see the included the
     dbdchart.html manpage webpage.  See the DBI(3) manpage for
     details on	DBI.  See the GD(3) manpage, the GD::Graph(3)
     manpage for details about the graphing engines.

     Installation

     For Windows users,	use WinZip or similar to unpack	the file,
     then copy Chart.pm	to wherever your site-specific modules
     are kept (usually \Perl\site\lib\DBD for ActiveState Perl
     installations). Also create a 'Chart' directory in	the DBD
     directory,	and copy the Plot.pm module to the new directory.
     Note that you won't be able to execute the	install	test with
     this, but you need	a copy of 'nmake' and all its libraries
     to	run that anyway. I may whip up a PPM in	the future.

     For Unix, extract it with

	 gzip -cd DBD-Chart-0.20.tar.gz	| tar xf -

     and then enter the	following:

	 cd DBD-Chart-0.20
	 perl Makefile.PL
	 make
	 make test

     If	any tests fail,	let me know. Otherwise go on with

	 make install

     Note that you probably need root or administrator
     permissions.  If you don't	have them, read	the
     ExtUtils::MakeMaker man page for details on installing in
     your own directories. the ExtUtils::MakeMaker manpage.

     your favorite browser.  It	includes all the usage
     information.
